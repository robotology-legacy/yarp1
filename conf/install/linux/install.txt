Configuring YARP for LINUX

$Id: install.txt,v 1.1 2003-08-12 16:50:52 gmetta Exp $

This file is in: $YARP_ROOT/conf/install/linux

REQUIRES:
	- ACE 5.3.3 from: http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html
	- IPL 2.5 from Intel ----> or IPP (not for free!)

0) licensing:
	- the template of the academic free licence can be found in
		%YARP_ROOT%\conf\licence.template

1) before compiling:
	- Check out from cvs on sourceforge: www.sourceforge.net
	- unzip ACE on top of ACE_wrappers under $YARP_ROOT/src/libraries/
		and UNCHECK the option to overwrite the files (this leaves
		the modified files from the repository inplace)
		OR
	- unzip and then copy with -i option, do not overwrite.
	- install IPL to get the DLLs, libs, and .h files
		WHERE TO COPY THEM?
		copy .h files into $YARP_ROOT/include/sys
		ALSO: look at the script under library/ipl for installation of IPL. see below.
	- use the $YARP_ROOT/YARPConfigTemplate.h and include the correct 
		config file (found in $YARP_ROOT/include/conf)
		Copy the template into: $YARP_ROOT/include/conf/YARPConfig.h

2) Compile:
	ACE, this copies also the .h, .i, and .cpp files into $YARP_ROOT/include
		- make symlink of ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU to platform_macros.GNU
		- remember to create your $YARP_ROOT/include/conf/YARPConfig.h to include YARPConfigLinux.h
		- use ace/config.h provided from cvs. Do not change it!
		- compile using make ace_only
		- install using make yarpize. this copies file to YARP dirs.


	os_services
		- use makefile: $YARP_ROOT/src/libraries/os_services
			- remember make install to install and copy files

	compile logpolar library, this is now the actual simulation of one of
		the CMOS chips. ONLY LogPolarSmallSDK is required to compile 
		images.

	images
		- go to $YARP_ROOT\src\libraries\ipl and run script to install
			include files, DLL's and libs.
		- compile the fakeipl first. even if you don't use it, just in case.
		- compile the main img processing lib.
		- compile the tools.
		- ?? run the lib command ??

	===

	math	
		- dsw in: %YARP_ROOT%\src\libraries\math\math.dsw

	utils
		- dsw in: %YARP_ROOT%\src\libraries\utils\utils.dsw

	hardware
		- run the install_orig_dd.bat. it copies the libraries+includes 
			in the correct directories.
		- dsw project in: %YARP_ROOT%\src\hardware\src\alldrivers.dsw
			it does the install but...

	motorcontrol
		- dsw in: %YARP_ROOT%\src\libraries\motorcontrol\motorcontrol.dsw
			compile and install automatically.


3) What to include/link for building an application is YARP.
	TO BE COMPLETED, templates?

4) Stuff under %YARP_ROOT%/conf
	- namer.conf.template: to be compied into namer.conf
		it contains the name and port of the machine running the yarp name
		service
	- ROBOTNAME directories, one for each robot we ever used with yarp (new version)
