QUICK START for Debian Linux users:
-----------------------------------

  YARP requires the ACE package.
    apt-get install libace-dev libace5.4 (as superuser)

  To compile YARP, try typing
    make
    make install  (as superuser)

  If you wish to install libraries and header files, try typing
    make devinstall  (as superuser)

The makefiles currently want to install stuff in /usr/local.  Apologies
in advance if you have to go fiddle with that.


MORE GENERAL method:
--------------------

We require ACE version 5.3.3 or greater.

On Debian-based linux machines, ACE is available as a binary package;
simply type ``apt-get install libace-dev'' as super-user. Please check
(e.g. by searching at http://packages.debian.org) that the version
available is 5.3.3 or greater. At the time of writing, this is true
for Debian unstable but not true for Debian stable.

For all other scenarios, we suggest you go to the ACE homepage, and
download and compile the source package:

    http://www.cs.wustl.edu/schmidt/ACE.html 

If you are a windows user, look for Visual Studio project files.  If you 
are a unix user, fiddle with Makefiles.

If you feel inspired, please send us better installation
instructions -- because boy do we need them.


INTEGRATION with Intel IPL:
---------------------------

YARP is compatible with but does not include (or require) the Intel 
Image Processing Library.  Here are tips for using IPL and YARP 
together.

 * include the IPL header files before any of the YARP image headers

 * Make sure you define HAVE_IPL before including any of the YARP image
   headers

 * Link with the IPL library
