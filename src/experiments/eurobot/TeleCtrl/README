In order to set the teleoperation platform up:

(0) [on europa] launch yarp-service --run

(1) [on atlas] turn on tracker and dataglove

(2) [on atlas] launch teleoperATIOOOON.js
    ---> this will start two camview's (for the slave's eyes) and
         mirrorCollector (for the master's sensors)

(3) [on europa] start start_all.sh
    ---> this will start repeater and headcontrol (for the slave's
         head) plus the two grabbers for the slave's eyes

(4) [on europa] start TeleCtrl
    ---> this will realize the connection between master and slave
