dvgrab-shell is based on dvgrab.  

dvgrab-shell can be used just just dvgrab, except that it is easier to
add image processing.  This is not really intended for movie processing,
but for real-time machine vision using a camcorder.

sidetap.h and sidetap.cc are the files to modify to make dvgrab-shell 
perform the operation you want.  A function called Apply() is called 
with successive images (and sound frames) from the camcorder.

The README for dvgrab is below.

To use the program, turn on the camera, press play, and run the program:

dvgrab --frames 200 myfilm-

If you have properly configured your kernel and your ieee1394 device
drivers, you should end up with about 30 MByte of DV image data nicely
packed in a file myfilm-001.avi (digits and extension automatically
appended), which can be displayed with the Microsoft Media Player or a
similar program (remember to install the required DV codecs, software
should be included with your hardware).

Read the man page for more documentation or 'dvgrab --help'.
