 * A class that encapsulates the concept of an input socket (in some

 * for the operation. Typically this allows calling a generic
 * read/write that the thread then specializes.

 * methods that allow reading from certain communication channels. In
 * particular, for sockets, there's going to be a call to accept()
 * somewhere and the creation of a new receiver socket. Subsequently 
 * the code should select() on the sockets or spawn new threads to
 * handle all the connections.
 * For QNET this same base class is used but clearly the socket
