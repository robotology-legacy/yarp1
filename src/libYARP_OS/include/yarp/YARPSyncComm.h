 * This class implements a general synchronous communication model. It's just a container

 * indexed by the thread id (for sockets) and in thread specific storage for QNX/QNET 
 * protocol. This assumes there's at most one and only one communication channel per 
 * thread. Communication threads create an enpoint and use it further on to
 * keep communicating always through the same endpoint. Also, VERY IMPORTANT, the
 * synchronous communication model is not correct for every protocol. In practice,
 * it's synchronous only for TCP and SHMEM, while is simply unidirectional (no reply)
 * for UDP and MCAST. Functions are simple enough since most of the work is carried out
 * by sockets (at the communication level) or by the port code (at the formatting and 
 * message preparation level).
