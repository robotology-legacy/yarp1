some words on how to install YARP.

\subsection{The ACE library}

First need ACE.

Debian: ``apt-get install libACE'' (currently the version in stable is
older than we support, use unstable if you can, otherwise compile from
source) -- (should document the dependencies for a fresh machine by watching
what apt-get loads).


SuSE: before compiling ACE source, get packages ``openssl'' and
``openssl-devel'' (from command-line: ``yast -i openssl'' and ``yast
-i openssl-devel'') if they are not already present.  Perhaps only
need to do the second one and the first will be automatically
downloaded.
