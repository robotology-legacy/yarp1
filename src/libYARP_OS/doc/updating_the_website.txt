On linux:

goto:
$YARP_ROOT/src/libYARP_OS/doc/manual and type make prep

it'll generate the html under: ./manual

then copy the files in: 
 htdocs/doc-yarp0/doc/manual/manual

on the YARP website. The doc directory is exactly the same in libYARP_OS/doc (copied).
Don't foget to check the permissions (rw to group, r to others)

The other directories in:
 htdocs/doc-yarp0/doc/

are the Doxygen output. Also to be copied on the website and permissions checked.
