This is the beginnings of a Java interface to YARP.  It is not yet
functional.  However, already it is probably a better source for
understanding the basic communication protocol than the C++ code.  Only
the TCP component of the protocol has been touched on so far though.

Hopefully we will write the protocol down explicitly at some point :-)
