+ more yarp2 unit tests

+ make yarp2 deal with thread priorities, windows multimedia timer stuff

+ synchronize namespaces and header file directories?

+ testing of yarp2 library against large sets of code using yarp1 header 
files

+ yarp2 implementation of yarp1-style buffering

+ yarp2 implementation of shmem (maybe with real 0 copy in cases where
  that is possible?)

+ yarp2 implementation rate threads

+ easy packaging, and installation instructions

+ move documentation to $YARP_ROOT/docs
