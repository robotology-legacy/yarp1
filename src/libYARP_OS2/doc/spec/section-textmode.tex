Suppose we have created ports as follows by typing the
following in different terminals:
\begin{code}
  yarp server
  yarp write /write
  yarp read /read
  yarp read /read2
\end{code}
%
We could connect and disconnect ports using the YARP companion
utility, but here's how we could do the same thing ``manually'':

\begin{code}
command:  yarp where
response: Name server is available at ip 192.168.0.3 port 10000

command:  telnet 192.168.0.3 10000
type:     NAME_SERVER query /write
response: registration name /write ip 192.168.0.3 port 10001 type tcp
          *** end of message
          [connection closes]

command:  telnet 192.168.0.3 10001
type:     CONNECT anonymous
response: Welcome anonymous
type:     *
response: This is /write
          There are no outgoing connections
          There is this connection from anonymous to /write using protocol tcp
          *** end of message
type:     /read
response: Connected to /read
type:     *
response: This is /write
          There is a connection from /write to /read using protocol tcp
          There is this connection from anonymous to /write using protocol tcp
          *** end of message
type:     !/read
response: Removing connection from /write to /read
type:     /mcast://read
response: Connected to /read
type:     /read2
response: Connected to /read2
type:     *
response: This is /write
          There is a connection from /write to /read using protocol mcast
          There is a connection from /write to /read2 using protocol tcp
          There is this connection from anonymous to /write using protocol tcp
          *** end of message
type:     q
response: Bye bye
          [connection closes]

command:  telnet 192.168.0.3 10000
type:     NAME_SERVER query /read
response: registration name /write ip 192.168.0.3 port 10002 type tcp
          *** end of message
          [connection closes]

command:  telnet 192.168.0.3 10002
type:     CONNECT anonymous
response: Welcome anonymous
type:     *
response: This is /read
          There are no outgoing connections
          There is a connection from /write to /read using protocol mcast
          There is this connection from anonymous to /read using protocol tcp
          *** end of message
type:     q
response: Bye bye
          [connection closes]

\end{code}
