\section{C++}

There is a partially-conforming implementation of YARP2 written
in C++.  It is available in CVS from:
\begin{code}
  CVSROOT = cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/yarp0
  Modules = yarp/src/libYARP_OS yarp/src/tools yarp/conf
\end{code}
See yarp0.sourceforge.net for instructions on how to access this.
This code is mature, well-tested, but does not yet conform fully
with the protocols described in this document.

There is a drop-in replacement implementation of YARP2 being developed
in:

\begin{code}
  Modules = yarp/src/libYARP_OS2
\end{code}

\indent
That implementation follows this document carefully, but at the
time of writing is not yet tested much in the real world.

\section{Matlab}

There is a Matlab wrapper around the C++ implementation --
see {\tt yarp/src/libYARP\_matlab} in the above repository.

\section{Python}

Python wrappers around the C++ implementation exist.


\section{Java}

There is a conforming implementation of YARP2 written in Java.
It is available in CVS from in the {\tt yarp/src/java}
directory.
See yarp0.sourceforge.net for instructions on how to access this.
