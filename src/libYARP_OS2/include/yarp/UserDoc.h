 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to the YARP OS library.  This library interfaces
 * with your operating system and provides some basic services.
 * We give you
 * \link yarp::os::Thread Thread\endlink, 
 * \link yarp::os::Semaphore Semaphore\endlink, and 
 * \link yarp::os::Time Time\endlink
 * services just in case
 * you don't have them, but our main goal is to give you easy network
 * communication using the YARP 
 * \link yarp::os::Port Port\endlink
 *Network.
 *
 * @section install_sec What is a Port?
 *
 * A \link yarp::os::Port Port\endlink is an object that can read and
 * write values to peer objects spread throughout a network of
 * computers.  You can create them in your program, and then add and
 * remove connections either from that program, from the command line,
 * or from another program.
 * Ports are specialized for streaming communication, such as camera
 * images or motor commands.  You can switch network protocols for any
 * or all your connections without changing a line of code.
 *
 * @section example_sec Give me an example!
 *
 * Yes, I should do that, shouldn't I...
