If all else fails, follow this sequence:

1) Shutoff the gyro power.

2) slay -n3 isd

3) stty +flush < //3/dev/ser1

4) Power up the gyro.

5) Wait until the gyro finishes warming up.  This takes about 3-5 minutes.
You can check to see when it is done by looking for the CTS line on the
serial port to be set high.  Type "stty < //3/dev/ser1" and look on the last
line.  When you see "+cts" rather than "-cts" then the gyro is ready to
receive data.

6) start-isd
