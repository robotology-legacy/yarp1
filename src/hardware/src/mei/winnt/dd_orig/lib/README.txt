medvc50f.lib is the static lib required to link and load the DLL.

You can find it in the dlls folder after installing the MEI device driver.

Please note that if you want to link the static library you have to link
ANOTHER lib; this library is again medvc50f.lib but it is placed in the
lib folder.
