ueid2: the driver for the UEI PowerDAQ PCI card.  

Disclosure requires that I state that this driver sucks.  It's
based on an even suckier hacked-up module sent to me from UEI.  Someday,
someone cool should take the full PowerDAQ library (assuming UEI
ever finishes it) and implement all the rest of the functions. 

Right now, you can pretty much only read a2d values, all at once.
But you can do it damn fast.  :)  Hooray for PCI!
