BTTVX CHANGES
-------------

20-May-2002 (Version 0.1.0)
	First version 0.1.0.
	Working with PAL images

31-May-2002 (Version 0.2.0)
	Added a test photon program to see the video.
	Improvement in the RISC program.
	Color acquisition

18-June-2002 (Version 0.2.1)
	Some cleaning in the photon program.           
	Uncommented the close() line in the photon program; this resolves the
	"Error reading myfile.dat..." problem. Thanks Johan!
	Added some syncronization stuff in the make_rawrisctab() function. This
	seems to resolve the lines with "crap" data in the top of the image.
	Added some stuff for NTSC. I don't know if it works. In theory one
	could activate NTSC by putting the variable btv->win.norm = 1 in the
	init_bt848(...) function.
	Some cleaning in the code (unnecessary stuff) 
 
20-June-2002
	Removed BT848_FIFO_STATUS_VRE flag in lines 330 and 332, they seem 
	to cause problems reported by Johan.
	Added a parameter in the main function to allow user to set PAL or NTSC
	in the command line. One can do "./bttvx 0" or "./bttvx 1" to 
	chose PAL or NTSC respectively.
	Added changes suggested by Kevin Radke to work with NTSC.
	Added a Makefile so things are more in order -this stars to
	seem a serious project :) -. Thanks again Johan.
