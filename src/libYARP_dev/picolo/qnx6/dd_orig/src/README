Ok, here you have a copy of the 0.2.2 of BTTVX; this is an adaptation of 
the BTTV linux driver for Conexant BT8xx based cards to work with QNX 6.1.
I have used a mix of BTTV driver old versions; you can find information about
BTTV here:

http://www.metzlerbros.de/mbros/bttv.html

The modern version of the BTTV are a little complicated and they have a lot of Linux 
specific stuff so they are harder to import. 

It is a draft code so I apologize if you don't see things nicely write. 

ATTENTION: This is a code WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. It could damage your computer so be sure 
to save all your important data!!!. 

You should compile the code by doing:

make all

Don't play attention to the warning for the moment.
After you should run bttvx (as root):

./bttvx

This should run the driver. Then you should be able to see the images by 
executing the "test" photon visualizer.
In another terminal window (from photon) type:

bttvx_0.2.2/test/src/gcc_ntox86/test

"Test" is a Photon Application Builder (PhAB) application.  

The setup I use is:

Camera Canon VC-C1
QNX 6.1
Framegrabber AverMedia (Aver-EzCapture) [bt878 based]

I will appreciate a lot any feedback, bugs, possible improvements,etc
