=============================================================================

Module "AS1"       (bean LIRA_SerialPort)
   AS1_RecvChar -If any data received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns error code (it does not wait for 
                data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.
   AS1_SendChar -Send one character to the channel. This method is available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   AS1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Return number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver property 
                is enabled.
   AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Return number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the transmitter 
                property is enabled.

Module "CAN1"      (bean MotorolaCAN)
   CAN1_SetAcceptanceCode -Set acceptance code register.
   CAN1_SetAcceptanceMask -Set the acceptance mask registers.
   CAN1_SetAcceptanceMode -Set a content of the acceptance mode register.
   CAN1_SendFrame -Send a frame.
   CAN1_ReadFrame -Read a frame.
   CAN1_GetStateTX -Return a value of the transmission complete flags.
   CAN1_GetStateRX -Return a value of the reception complete flag.
   CAN1_GetError -Return a content of the receiver flag register.

Module "QD1"       (bean LIRA_DECODER_A)
   QD1_SetPosition -This method sets position counter.
   QD1_GetPosition -This method gets position counter. Position value is captured toi the difference hold register and 
                difference counter is cleared.
   QD1_InitPosition -This method triggers initialization of position counter from position initialization register.

Module "QD2"       (bean LIRA_DECODER_B)
   QD2_SetPosition -This method sets position counter.
   QD2_GetPosition -This method gets position counter. Position value is captured toi the difference hold register and 
                difference counter is cleared.
   QD2_InitPosition -This method triggers initialization of position counter from position initialization register.

Module "IFsh1"     (bean IntFLASH)
   IFsh1_SetByteFlash -Write byte to address in FLASH.
   IFsh1_SetWordFlash -Write word to address in FLASH.
   IFsh1_GetWordFlash -Get word from address in FLASH.
   IFsh1_SetLongFlash -Write long word to address in FLASH.
   IFsh1_GetLongFlash -Get long word from address in FLASH.

Module "PWMC1"     (bean LIRA_PWM_A)
   PWMC1_Enable -Enable the bean - it starts the signal generation. Events can be disabled/enabled by DisableEvent/EnableEvent.
   PWMC1_Disable -Disable the bean - it stops signal generation and events calling. When the timer is disabled, it is possible 
                to call method "SetOutput" to control the output value on corresponding pin.
   PWMC1_SetDuty -Setting duty(value) register of selected channel.  The value is loaded after calling Load() method.
   PWMC1_SetDutyPercent -Setting duty(value) in percent of selected channel.  The value is loaded after calling Load() method.
   PWMC1_Load -Apply last seting of the methods SetDuty, SetDutyPercent, SetPeriod and SetPrescaler.
   PWMC1_OutputPadEnable -Method enables output pads.
   PWMC1_OutputPadDisable -Method disables output pads.

Module "PWMC2"     (bean LIRA_PWM_B)
   PWMC2_Enable -Enable the bean - it starts the signal generation. Events can be disabled/enabled by DisableEvent/EnableEvent.
   PWMC2_Disable -Disable the bean - it stops signal generation and events calling. When the timer is disabled, it is possible 
                to call method "SetOutput" to control the output value on corresponding pin.
   PWMC2_SetDuty -Setting duty(value) register of selected channel.  The value is loaded after calling Load() method.
   PWMC2_SetDutyPercent -Setting duty(value) in percent of selected channel.  The value is loaded after calling Load() method.
   PWMC2_Load -Apply last seting of the methods SetDuty, SetDutyPercent, SetPeriod and SetPrescaler.
   PWMC2_OutputPadEnable -Method enables output pads.
   PWMC2_OutputPadDisable -Method disables output pads.

Module "TI1"       (bean TimerInt)

Module "Cpu"       (bean 56F807)
   Cpu_GetSpeedMode -Get current speed mode
   Cpu_EnableInt -Enable all maskable interrupts
   Cpu_DisableInt -Disable all maskable interrupts
   Cpu_SetWaitMode -Set low power mode - Wait mode.
For more information about the wait mode see documentation of this CPU.
                
Release from wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   Cpu_SetStopMode -Set low power mode - Stop mode.
For more information about the stop mode see documentation of this CPU.
   Cpu_SetDataMode -Set the Data memory map to use either internal & external resources OR external resources only.
