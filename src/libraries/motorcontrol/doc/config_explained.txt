//NOTE: njoints must always =7 in this implementation.

The number of joints.
Do not change this because the only supported mode of operation is with 7
joints. It should not be a problem to extend the class to handle different
cases but it must be done carefully.

joint to axis conversion number - 7 values.
they are respectively:
eye tilt
right eye
left eye
top diff
bottom diff
head pan
head tilt

differential joint: 2 numbers
head tilt
head roll

for each joint. MEI gain params:
these are checked at startup against those in the MEI boot memory.
COEFFICIENTS * number of joints.

calibration offset.
this is a vector of njoints elements.

default velocity.
a vector of njoints elements.

limits max and min (2 vectors of njoints components)
for all but the differential joint(s) the limits are relative to the zero 
and restrict the range with respect to the maximum determined during
calibration.
for the differential joints (3,4 usually) the limits represent the 
absolute limit - this is measured beforehand with respect to a typical
calibration using the gyros.

maxerror (a vector a njoints components):
a vector of maximum allowed error during calibration.
this determines the stop condition when the hard stop is hit.

encoder to angles coeff. a vector of njoints components.
the conversion factor from encoder to degrees.
