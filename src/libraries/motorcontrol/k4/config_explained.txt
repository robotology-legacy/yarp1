//NOTE: at this level everything is measured in encoder ticks.
//NOTE: njoints must always = 8 in this implementation.

The number of joints.
Do not change this because the only supported mode of operation is with 8
joints. It should not be a problem to extend the class to handle different
cases but it must be done carefully.

joint to axis conversion number - 8 values.
they are respectively:
neck tilt
right eye pan
left eye pan
eye tilt
neck pan
head roll
head tilt
neck crane

for each joint. MEI gain params:
these are checked at startup against those in the MEI boot memory.
COEFFICIENTS * number of joints.

calibration offset.
this is a vector of njoints elements.
this is not currently being used.

default velocity.
a vector of njoints elements.

limits max and min (2 vectors of njoints components)
for all but the differential joint(s) the limits are relative to the zero 
and restrict the range with respect to the maximum determined during
calibration.

maxerror (a vector a njoints components):
a vector of maximum allowed error during calibration.
this determines the stop condition when the hard stop is hit.
this is not currently being used, because we're not calibrating the motors
this way.

encoder to angles coeff. a vector of njoints components.
the conversion factor from encoder to degrees.
this is also not currently used b/c the conversion is done on client's side,
using functions provided by YAPOCMessage class.
