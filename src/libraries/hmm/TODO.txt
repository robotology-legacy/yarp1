- Fix the problem when an impossible state is encountered during learning.
- Also when likelihood decreases the result is crap - verify where the problem is.

- Allow partial recognition (1 sample at a time).

- Allow partial training (1 sequence at a time).
	--- Not feasible... it works batch because it needs data to form
		the statistics about the sequences/transitions/etc.
