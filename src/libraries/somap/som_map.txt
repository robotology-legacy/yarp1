- problems?

This SW is absolutely unreliable. 
It's a miracle it works as it is but there's no guarantee that it
might fail in other situations. Unfortunately porting this SW was a very
bad idea. It would have been much simpler and safer to simply
reimplement the self organizing map.

LATER: reimplement from scratch.
