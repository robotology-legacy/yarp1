GyroTester

A graphical user interface for the Inter-Sense 3-axis inertial package.
Serves both as an example of how to interface to the ISD daemon and as an
example of how to build PHAB applications.  Also allows for basic commands
(such as boresight) to be sent to the daemon, providing an interface-level 
control.
