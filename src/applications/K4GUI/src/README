This application is developed using QNX's PhAB (Photon App Builder).
To open application: $ appbuilder -n
PhAB GUI should appear. 
Existing application can be opened by giving PhAB its top directory. 
For example: to open this application, look under: 
/ai/ai/mb/cdp/src/YARP/src/applications, a list of directories should appear, 
including K4GUI. clicking on K4GUI will open this application.

Compiling can be done in the PhAB GUI or by simply typing make in the
/ai/ai/mb/cdp/src/YARP/src/applications/K4GUI/src directory.
.o and executable files are automatically placed in the default directory.

For details on programming in PhAB, see PhAB manual.
