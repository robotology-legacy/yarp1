Running YARP code from within Matlab 6.5 (R13)

- run the mex configuration script from within matlab. mex -setup
- compile the YARP support file (mex projects dll's) and install them (automatic)


FOR more information please refer to the original matlab documentation

--> other versions of matlab. I suspect everything should work fine at least on R12, never tested though.
