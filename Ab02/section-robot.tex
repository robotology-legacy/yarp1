\section{The experimental platform}

This work is implemented on the robot Cog, an upper torso humanoid
\cite{brooks99cog}.  The robot has previously been applied to tasks
such as visually-guided pointing \cite{Marjanovic-96-SAB}, and
rhythmic operations such as turning a crank or driving a slinky
\cite{williamson98neural}.  Cog has two arms, each of which has six
degrees of freedom -- two per shoulder, elbow, and wrist.  The joints
are driven by series elastic actuators \cite{williamson95series} --
essentially a motor connected to its load via a spring (think strong
and torsional rather than loosely coiled).  The arm is not designed to
enact trajectories with high fidelity.  For that a very stiff arm is
preferable.  Rather, it is designed to perform well when interacting
with a poorly characterized environment, where collisions are frequent
and informative events.

  Degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the robot Cog.  The arms terminate
  either in a primitive ``flipper'' or a four-fingered hand.

The hand
  is an independent research project by Matthew Marjanovi\'{c}, and
  will not be employed or described here.

  The head, torso, and arms
  together contain 22 degrees of freedom.
