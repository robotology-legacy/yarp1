\section{Introduction}

A robot is an actor in its environment and not simply a passive
observer.  This gives it the potential to examine the world using
causality, by performing probing actions and learning from the
response.  Tracing chains of causality from motor action to perception
(and back again) is important both to understand how the brain deals
with sensorimotor coordination and to implement those same functions
in an artificial system, such as a humanoid robot.

\ifverbose
In the context of sensorimotor coordination causality can be operationally
defined as a functional link between some variables, being these motor,
sensorial, or both.  At higher levels of abstaction other quantities might
need to be considered, not necessarily, purely sensorial or motor but
rather combinations of various sort. Causality accounts to discovering
similarity and recurrence in this sensorimotor data, possibly delayed of
unknown amounts.
\fi

In this paper, we propose that such causal probing can be arranged in
a developmental sequence leading to a manipulation-driven
representation of objects.  We present results for two important
steps along the way, and describe how we plan to proceed.

Table~\ref{tab:causation} shows three levels of causal complexity.
The simplest causal chain that the robot experiences is the
perception of its own actions.  The temporal aspect is immediate:
visual information is tightly synchronized to motor commands.
We use this strong correlation to identify parts of the robot
body -- specifically, the end-point of the arm. 

Once this causal connection is established, we can go further and use
it to active explore the boundaries of objects.  In this case, there
is one more step in the causal chain, and the temporal nature of
the response may be delayed since initiating a reaching movement doesn't
immediately elicit consequences in the environment.  

\ifverbose
relation and a
more subtle perception of space has also to be taken into account, e.g
localization of the effector, and the spatial relation with the
manipulated object.  The temporal aspect in this case assumes a
delayed form: triggering a reaching movement doesn't immediately
elicit consequences in the environment.


We
show how an active exploration strategy might explain how newborns
develop, during ontogenesis, figure-ground segregation capabilities.
The temporal aspect in this case assumes a delayed form: triggering a
reaching movement doesn't automatically elicit consequences in the
environment. Towards reaching completion a more immediate form can
take place due to correlation between the haptic and visual responses.
\fi

Finally we argue that extending this causal chain further will allow
us to approach the representational power of ``mirror
neurons''~\cite{fadiga00visuomotor}, where a connection is made
between our own actions and the actions of another.

\ifverbose
The third case is a more conceptual one and it represents our more long
term goal in terms of robotic implementation. It is interesting though
because it can be explained by the same principle of causality. This
is the case of ``mirror neurons''~\cite{fadiga00visuomotor}. The
details of this third example are presented later.  Development takes
an even more delayed form involving probably a form of long-term
memory. Our everyday personal experience on the manipulation of objects is
reused to interpret the same class of manipulative acts when performed
by somebody else.  Clearly the two situations, when acting and when watching,
 are not necessarily simultaneous.
\fi

\ifverbose
This solves a problem,
difficult if addressed visually, by taking advantage of the fact the
system is embodied.  There are examples of similar behaviors in
newborns [I still have to find the refs in this case]. The level of
causality exploited here is a direct one. 
\fi

\ifverbose
  Of
course, processing delays must be accounted for -- in the brain,
delays are known to depend on the modality (e.g. vision is slower than
for example vestibular signals) and consequently multisensory or
sensorimotor integration has to compensate for them.
\fi



\ifverbose
There is a bulk of neuroscience data on all this aspect of human
sensorimotor cognition. For the purpose of this paper, we first would
like to show that there is indeed a problem if the agent is not
properly situated[? does it make any sense ?]. A nice example is the
definition of ``object''.  We will devote a
section to illustrate this point which turns out to be central in a
series of tasks including the three cases analyzed before. Many of our everyday's
acts are definitely object-oriented.

Developmentally we can explain what is an ``object'' by exploiting
the fact that the agent is embodied.
By looking at the three examples, we can notice a trend in complexity, 
and consequently we can hypothesize, that the time required to reach proficiency 
in each task is proportional to this complexity. Table~\ref{tab:causation} shows this idea.

\ifverbose
The more strict
temporal aspect on the other hand require perfect timing (within the
bandwidth of the process considered of course), but the cause-effect
linkage is a direct one.
For the purposes of manipulation, we would like to know what parts of
the environment are physically coherent ensembles -- that is, which
parts will move together, and which are more or less independent.  It
takes a great deal of experience before this judgement can be made
from purely visual information.  This paper develops active strategies
for acquiring that experience through experimental manipulation, using
tight correlations between arm motion and optic flow to detect both
the arm itself and the boundaries of objects with which it comes into
contact.

\section{The elusive object}

\label{sect:introduction}

Sensory information is intrinsically ambiguous, and very distant from
the world of well-defined objects in which humans believe they live.  
What criterion should be applied to distinguish one object from
another?  How can perception support such a phenomenon as figure-ground
segmentation?  
Consider the example in Figure~\ref{fig:number-cross}.  It is
immediately clear that the drawing on the left is a cross, perhaps
because we already have a criterion, which allows segmenting on the
basis of the intensity difference. It is slightly less clear that the
zeros and ones on the middle panel are still a cross. What can we say
about the array on the right? If we are not told, and we do not have
the criterion to perform the figure-ground segmentation, we might
think this is just a random collection of numbers. But if we are told
that the criterion is ``prime numbers vs. non-prime'' then a cross can
still be identified.

While we have to be inventive to come up with a segmentation problem
that tests a human, we don't have to go far at all to find something
that baffles our robots.  Figure~\ref{fig:setup-sequence} shows a
robot's-eye view of a cube sitting on a table.  Simple enough, but
many rules of thumb used in segmentation fail in this particular case.
And even an experienced human observer, diagnosing the cube as a
separate object based on its shadow and subtle differences in the
surface texture of the cube and table, could in fact be mistaken --
perhaps some malicious researcher is up to mischief.  The only way to
find out for sure is to take action, and start poking and prodding.
As early as 1734, Berkeley observed that:
%
\begin{quote}
...objects can only be known by
touch. Vision is subject to illusions, which arise from the
distance-size problem... \cite{berkeley72new}
\end{quote}
%
In this paper, we provide support for a more nuanced proposition: that
in the presence of touch, vision becomes more powerful, and many of
its illusions fade away.

\subsubsection*{A working hypothesis}


Taken together this results from neuroscience suggest a very basic role
for motor action. 
%%In particular, for the problem of getting an operational 
%%definition of object, it seems that action is a necessary component.
%%Taken together, these results from neuroscience suggest that relating
%%motor action to visual perception is fruitful.  
Certainly vision and action are
intertwined at a very basic level.  While an
experienced adult can interpret visual scenes perfectly well without
acting upon them, linking action and perception seems crucial to the
developmental process that leads to that competence.  We can construct
a working hypothesis: that action is required to object recognition in
cases where an agent has to develop categorization autonomously.  Of
course in standard supervised learning action is not required since
the trainer does the job of pre-segmenting the data by hand.  In an
ecological context, some other mechanism has to be provided.
Ultimately this mechanism is the body itself that through action
(under some suitable developmental rule) generates informative
percepts.

\ifverbose
NEW In this paper, we explore this link between the robot body, action,
and perception with a long-term goal of designing the architecture for
development through the natural interaction of the robot with a human
teacher. Elements of the general architecture are action and object
understanding, imitation, and ``tasking by showing''. Some behaviors
we investigated include the control of gaze (where to look), and
attentional system (what to look), and reaching (how to get the robot
effectors at manipulative distances).
\fi

Neurons in area F4 are thought to provide a body map useful for
generating arm, head, and trunk movements. Our robot learns
autonomously a crude version of this body map by fusing vision and
proprioception.  As a step towards establishing the kind of visuomotor
representations seen in F5, we then develop a mechanism for using
reaching actions to visually probe the connectivity and physical
extent of objects without any prior knowledge of the appearance of the
objects (or indeed of the arm itself).

\ifverbose
The last case, that is the ``mirror neurons'' has not been implemented
yet.  We thus describe only the logic behind a possible
implementation. The logic as for the other two cases is based
extensively on the concept of causality.
\fi

\ifverbose
NEW If we had to draw a parallel with developmental neural science, we can
say we explored computationally some of the functions of the dorsal
pathway. A system similar to area F5 can provide the basis for action
and object understanding. This process of learning can be simply
initiated without necessarily solving problems such as the
object-background segregation. The exploration of object property can
situate the system favorably so to learn the criteria to be used for
segmentation later on in development.
