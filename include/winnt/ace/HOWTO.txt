How to use the build.bat to compile and install ACE on windows.

the script accepts two parameters:
1- the operation requested
2- the directory name where ACE is unpacked (from the zip file)

operations can be:
clean: as in make clean, removes all compilation intermediate file.
debug: compile with debug enabled.
release: compile optimized.
install: install on the default distribution

the script assumes YARP_ROOT environment variable is properly set.

the directory at point 2- requires also to include ACE_wrapper

examples:
build debug ..\..\..\src\ACE_wrappers
 - to build debug

build install ..\..\..\src\ACE_wrappers
 - to copy headers and libs to the "standard" places

Note: the config.h contained in this directory will be copied to
the correct place to compile (i.e.: ACE_wrappers\ace\) and then
removed on finish.
