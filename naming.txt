Naming conventions.

- by nat

Here is a draft of the naming convention we may be using in the future. 
The overall idea is to have names which are short, simple and readable.
Having said that, you'll find out that some solutions are not "optimal"
but have been chosen for aesthetic reasons.
Of course we can discuss them.

- Function names should start with lowercase letter. Multi-words names have
mixed case. I used to separete them with underscores, but this tends to make
names too long.

Examples:
computeOpticFlow();
doLoop();
...

- Private functions start with underscore. It may be useful To identify
private functions because often they modify member variables.

Example:
_alloc();
_freeMemory();

- Member variables start with underscore too. This is inspired both by ACE (where 
the undescore is at the end of the name) and by MFC (where there is a "m_" at 
the beginning).

Example:
bool _calibrated;
double *_actualPositions;

- Class names are capitalized. Multi-words names have mixed case. Within the library
they start with YARP.

Example:
YARPGenericImage
YARPGalilDeviceDriver
YARPMEIDeviceDriver	// this is an exeption because MEI is uppercase

- Macros and defines are all uppercase. To separate multi-words in this case we
are forced to use underscore.

Examples:
#define MY_TIME 10
#define HEAD_STATUS_DEBUG(string) \
	do {printf("HEAD_STATUS_DEBUG: "),printf string;} while(0)

- Constant variable names begin with double underscore "__".

Examples:
const int __nEcc = 32;
const int __nAng = 64;
const int __threadPeriod = 40;

- Parameters. Input parameters go first followed by output parameters. 
Of course don't forget to use const.

Examples:
convertImage(const YARPImage &in, YARPImage &out);

- It is a good practice to use plural names for vectors

Examples:
double *positions;
bool *flags;

- Templates... Do we need a naming convention too ? We could use names which are
self-explaining or prefix them with T.

Examples:
YARPImageOf<YarpRGBPixel>
GenericControlTemplate<>
TGenericControl<>

- Namespaces... I used to prefix namespace names with underscore. Better suggestions ?

Example:
namespace _hand
{}
